## PROJECTS
> ### 1.Road Traffic Accident Analysis
The  analyses  predicts road traffic accidents using a data-driven approach and machine learning models, with the goal of improving our understanding of contributing factors and developing predictive tools for accident prevention.  Assembled a large historic dataset that included information such as weather conditions, road types, traffic volume, and historical accident records.
>
To analyse this dataset and extract meaningful patterns, I've used 6 different machine learning algorithms including decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. The investigation reveals complex links between various factors and the occurrence of accidents. Machine learning models predict accidents with high accuracy based on historic data inputs, demonstrating their potential for proactive intervention and traffic management.
>
To demonstrates the effectiveness of a data-driven approach in road traffic accident analysis and prediction, We can develop systems capable of providing timely warnings and informing traffic management strategies to reduce the frequency and severity of accidents by leveraging the power of machine learning models. The findings advance the field of transportation safety and lay the groundwork for the development of intelligent accident prevention systems. 

This analysis includes the following sessions;
1.  Data Collection
2.  Data Preprocessing
3.  Model Training
4.  Model Evaluation
5.  Prediction

> ### [2. Beetle Game using control structures in python]([Beetle Game](https://github.com/abijithabi3416/Projects/tree/0e4da1e10403accd8219d3a81b04fc25cee53737/Beetle%20Game))
The Beetle game using control structures in python is developed to demonstrate the basic understanding of python programming language.
This python code includes basics of python programming and implementation of control structures to understand the work flow of code base.
The Beetle Game is a simple dice game where the player collects parts of a beetle by rolling a die. The game ends when the player has collected all the necessary parts to complete the beetle.
> 
-  The random module is imported to use the randint function for simulating dice rolls.
-  The dice_game function encapsulates the game logic.
-  collected_parts is a list to keep track of the collected beetle parts.
-  The game runs until 13 parts are collected, which includes 1 body, 1 head, 2 antennas, 2 eyes, 1 mouth, and 6 legs.
-  Simulates rolling a die, generating a random number between 1 and 6.
-  Checks if the roll is 1 and if the body part has not been collected yet. If true, adds the body part.
-  Calls the dice_game function to start the game.
